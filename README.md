In this work, a complete and novel approach based on deep learning techniques and mathematical morphology was proposed for the simultaneous detection of the optic disc and the fovea in fundus images. 
For the OD detection, we only make a simple prediction as a prior reference for fovea detection. 
For the fovea location, first, the dataset is classified by the classification network, and then we employed the Path Aggregation Network and Relation Network for the detection of the fovea. Finally, a lightweight regression network or the mathematical morphology method is considered to locate the fovea. 
The result demonstrates that different spatial resolutions and semantic information from multi-scale feature maps and the relationship between image features can effectively improve the detection performance. It has better accuracy and robustness than most traditional mathematical morphology methods and existing machine learning methods in different datasets with uneven illumination or severe lesions interference.
